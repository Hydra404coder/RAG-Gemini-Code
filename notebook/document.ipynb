If you are not a resident of India, you must employ an agent who resides in India to file the application on your behalf.\n",

      "    *   **Novelty or Originality:** It must not have been disclosed to the public through prior publication, prior use, or any other means.\n",
      "    *   **Significant Distinguishability:** It must be significantly different from designs already registered and existing in the public domain.\n",
