Artificial intelligence refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.
These tasks include understanding language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions based on data.

Machine learning enables systems to improve performance through experience.
Models learn from historical data using techniques such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

Large language models are neural networks trained on vast collections of text.
They generate responses, summarize documents, and answer questions in natural language.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhances language models by connecting them to external knowledge sources.
Relevant documents are retrieved and supplied as context before generating a response.

Vector databases store numerical representations of text called embeddings.
They allow efficient similarity search to find related information.

RAG-based systems increase reliability, reduce incorrect outputs, and support querying private or domain-specific data.
