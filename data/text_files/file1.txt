Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. 
AI systems can perform tasks such as reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning are common machine learning paradigms.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on massive text datasets to generate human-like responses.
They are commonly used in chatbots, document analysis, and question-answering systems.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines information retrieval with text generation.
Instead of relying only on model memory, RAG retrieves relevant documents and uses them as context.

Vector databases store embeddings that represent semantic meaning.
Similarity search allows retrieval of the most relevant chunks of information.

RAG systems improve factual accuracy, reduce hallucinations, and allow models to work with private data.
